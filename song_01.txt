 And just can't accept it Just can't be the end yet You promised to never leave And now you're gone, can't believe I can feel the world's within a way As you solely fade from my everyday You promised forever I love without it And now I'm left broken Struggling to mend I thought we were so tight Destined for a lifetime Love with no way Love with no way Sting in my imagination Memorizing the past time The secrets of the cat Now they're echoes in the air Still see your face in every place Feel your warm future to grace But now they're just at a space And I'm lost in the sadness chase Keeping you in my heart Peace if you are never let go The distance brings separation In my heart you'll always flow I just can't say goodbye Better how hard I try A bond I got is a deep and true Always be if you say or no Thought we were so tight Destined for a lifetime Love with no way Love with no way
